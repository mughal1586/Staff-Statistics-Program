Staff Statistics Program

Description
This C++ program manages employee data, allowing the user to input and display information for multiple employees.

Features
-   Takes employee number, name, and compensation as input.
-   Stores and displays employee details.
-   Utilizes classes and objects to represent employees.
-   Demonstrates the use of constructors, getters, and setters.
-   Includes functions to insert and display employee data.

Code Structure
The code consists of three files:

-   `main.cpp`: Contains the main function, which creates Employee objects and demonstrates the insert and display functionality.
-   `Employee.cpp`: Contains the implementation of the Employee class methods (constructors, getters, setters, insert, and display).
-   `header.h`: Contains the declaration of the Employee class.

Dependencies
-   iostream: For input/output operations.
-   string: For handling string data (employee names).

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the program, save the files with a .cpp extension (e.g., main.cpp, Employee.cpp, header.cpp) and use a C++ compiler.
